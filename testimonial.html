          <h3>“Heavenly Honeymoon”</h3>
          <p>We stayed for five nights in August 2012. We arrived at reception a little earlier than planned and were congratulated immediately on our recent wedding. We booked through asiarooms and so must have put in the comment box that it was our honeymoon. We were immediately ungraded to a luxury villa with a private pool without even asking. The hotel itself is beautiful and super clean. It is around 15 minute (horse and cart ride) away from the main strip but that was exactly what we wanted as it was lovely and private.<br/><br/> On our first night we were delivered a yummy cake congratulating us on our wedding, a lovely touch! The beach outside the hotel is lovely and sandy although quite abit of coral on the sea bed and so difficult to swim, go around the otherside of the island for a nicer sea swim. The sunset is beautiful from this part of the island, we had a perfect view from the loungers on the beach at around 6pm.<br/><br/> Staff were amazing and very attentive. The hotel was not crowded and so we could access all facilities at any point. The restaurant was lovely but we mainly went to the other side of the island for the evening just for a busier atmosphere. Scallywags (on the main strip) cook amazing food. Also book your snorkeling trips on this side of the island, we paid $10 each for a full day trip. Gili Trawangan is beautiful and this hotel gives you luxury and privacy on this amazing island. We would definitely stay again.</p>

          <h3>“Peaceful, serene, clean and friendly”</h3>
          <p>We've stayed at 4 hotels on Trawangan and this was by far the best. On the far side of the island, away from the beach noise. Great value, it was March, so $87 included breakfast, bikes and taxes. The room was lovely and clean with A/C and hot water. Nice big bathroom and super comfortable bed. The staff was helpful and knowledgeable.
          The pool has natural shade, loads of trees, birds singing and it's large enough to stay a bit cool. It's not on the beach, but we were happy to have the shade.
          The breakfast buffet was fantastic. They have a great chef - lot's of variety and everything was tasty and fresh.

          <h3>“Perfect Honeymoon!”</h3>
          <p>Queen villa is the best place for honeymoon couples. The place is very quiet and away from the crowds. The room very comfortable and feel like home. Staff are very friendly and helpful.
          They have a beautiful sunset spot on the beach and great view of a mountain
          I like the layout of the bathroom, I like the parks along to my room, a pool and bar and I love the view in the morning when breakfast.. 
          I just wanna come back next time for our anniversary!</p>

          <h3>“Great place”</h3>
          <p>We wanted to be away from the main area to ensure we had a peaceful sleep, and peaceful it was. We had 3 nights in total and we wish we had booked longer. The staff are extremely friendly and greet you every time like they have met you for the first time. Some staff are obviously new but full credit to their efforts for helping as they learn. They were forgetful at times with some room service requests but for the price we paid, it was painless to simply remind them and move on enjoying this beautiful place. <br/><br/>The best part was the room. Everything about the room is flawless especially the bed/bedding which was the best sleep I have ever had in any hotel around the world, by far!! So so comfy!! They gave us complimentary bike hire over the 4 days and were very helpful at every request. I weirdly packed a torch and it came in handy on the ride home from the main centre at night (about 15 mins peddling slow-med pace) because the bike lights don't work very well, but was very funny riding home. The only bad thing is that the beach across the road is on the windy side off island so swimming is best on the other side where beach bags and food/drink service is more frequent. All in all we enjoyed our stay and recommend it.</p>

          <h3>“Hidden Paradise”</h3>
          <p>Had a chance to stay at Queen Villas when I looked it thru tripadvisor, and had chosen it because it is the newest 5-star hotel in the Gili Trawangan.

          Had never made a better decision in my life.

          The hotel is very nice, has good ambience and atmosphere, really sets your mood for holiday.
          It is located on the quieter side of the island, and this the only point where you can enjoy the sunset (you can't enjoy the sunset on the crowded part of the island)

          We stayed in the villa for 5 nights, the villa had its own private pool, nice and comfy room and bed, huge bathroom, i feel the price is really worth it down to the single cent for the villas.<br/><br/>

          <b>The queen is the only hotel with big fresh water swimming pool and unlimited fresh water supply in your room </b>(i hope i was informed correctly, because this tiny island had no natural fresh water resources, they have to bring fresh water supplies from lombok island, therefore fresh water is a luxurious items on the island, or so i was informed, and actually on most of the hotels they actually provide the guests with seawater for shower/bathing, so the water at Queen is a big plus plus for me)

          Breakfast and hotel food was good. And if you wanna go the harbour for more selection of food and mingle with the crowd, renting a horse-cart is the most convenient, or you can rent a bike from the hotel and just cycle while enjoying the wind, waves sound, and view of the island, or you could go the bar, order beer a bottle or two for the road, and start walking strolling along the beach, very relaxing experience.<br/><br/>

          This hotel has its own dive center located right in front of the hotel, be sure not to miss it, and if you have never dived before, this is a perfect time to try, coz they have beginner crash course, and you can start diving on your second day, it's really a breathtaking experience, and an unforgotten one.

          Overall stay at the queen, a very memorable place, best holiday I've had, will definitely come back to this hotel.</p>

          <h3>“Spectacular resort in Gili Trawangan, off the beaten track”</h3>
          <p>I spent three nights in this lovely and exotic island off Lombok coast
          The choice made of Queen Villas was fantastic. This recently refurbished or built resort (it smells of brand-new yet) is located at the other side of the island Harbour, which serves as landmark to move around and where the hustle and bustle is at. <br/><br/>
          The hotel facilities are beautiful, as well as the luxury double room chosen, nicely decorated in modern but simple style. The hotel beach has some sun beds and beach restaurant though it gets hard to swim at this part of this island because of all the coral covering the beach.<br/><br/>
          One of the hotel highlights is the magnific sunset view you can get while walking to/from the Queen Villas hotel to the harbour along the island coastline. Despite the island is so cozy and nice, it was such a disappointment to see that the center of the island is full of rubbish, as there are no hotels or touristic resorts, just locals' houses.<br/><br/>
          It is advisable to hire bicycles to travel along the island coast but carriages can also be hired in the harbour or outside hotels, although walking along the island is a pleasure.
          Piece of advice: don't stop bargaining for better prices. Everything can de negotiated except for the public transport into an from other gili islands.
          The best beaches on the island rest near the harbour, though best idea is to take the public boat to Gili meno or Gili air, departing at 9 am and returning at 3 pm. 
          Gili trawanjan is the busiest of the three gili islands but still keeps a laid back atmosphere.</p>
